# Status

Phase 1, Task 1 (workspace split, dev shell, screenshot harness): done.

## What works
- `nix develop -c just build|test|clippy|fmt` on the `fedimix-core` + `fedimix-gtk` workspace.
- `nix develop -c just run` launches the placeholder window.
- `nix develop -c just screenshot <name> [args...]` renders the app headlessly
  (sway + grim) to `target/screenshots/<name>.png`.

## Next
Task 2.

## Needs user
Nothing.
